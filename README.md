# Speech Recognition to Sentiment Analysis

This project is a web application that performs sentiment analysis on speech input. It utilizes machine learning models for speech recognition and sentiment analysis and is built using Flask for the backend API and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to allow users to input speech and receive sentiment analysis results in real-time. The application uses the browser's speech recognition API to capture speech input from the user. The captured audio is then sent to the Flask backend, where it is processed using machine learning models for both speech recognition and sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis results are then sent back to the frontend and displayed to the user.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Used to create the backend API that handles speech processing and sentiment analysis.
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Used for the frontend interface to capture user speech input and display sentiment analysis results.
- **SpeechRecognition API**: Used to capture speech input from the user's browser.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used for both speech recognition and sentiment analysis. The exact models used can be specified here.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application by executing `python app.py` in the terminal.
4. Access the web application by navigating to `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser.

## Project Structure

- **app.py**: Contains the Flask application code, including routes for handling speech input and sentiment analysis.
- **templates/**: Contains HTML templates for the frontend interface.
- **static/**: Contains static files such as CSS and JavaScript for the frontend.
- **speech.ipynb**: Contains machine learning model used for speech recognition and sentiment analysis.

## Future Improvements

- **Improved User Interface**: Enhance the frontend interface for better user experience.
- **Model Optimization**: Optimize machine learning models for better accuracy and performance.
- **Support for Different Languages**: Extend support for multiple languages in both speech recognition and sentiment analysis.
